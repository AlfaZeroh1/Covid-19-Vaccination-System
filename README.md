# Covid-19-Vaccination-System
I was really inspired by Ministry of Health's Self-service Portal Website and wondered if such a system would be made available for small clinics and hospitals. I made the system offline but I'll store it here for now cause I might want to improve on it later and add more features.
It's a simple web app where a user creates an account then schedules for a vaccine dose. Vaccination is done by apointment so the system must check if slots are available from db, the nature of the vaccination: first dose or second dose, vaccine type and location. These parameters are used to schedule the vaccination date and once the user follows the whole process of vaccination, one can download a vaccination certificate from the system. The certificate is web generated but borrows data from the server. 
As of Januar 2022, I had built the system completely to a deployable stage and it achieves all the functions it's intended to at a basic level. Maybe in the future I can add some advanced feeatures like more locations, FAQ page, news & updates page, and a forum for the vaccinees.
